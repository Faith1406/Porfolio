        Hi, I'm Aditya Naidu, an enthusiastic AI/ML student with a deep passion for programming and building innovative solutions. My journey in technology is fueled by curiosity and a love for solving complex problems.

        Currently, I’m honing my skills in areas like React development, data structures and algorithms, and machine learning, while actively participating in hackathons like the Intel AI Hackathon to challenge myself and learn collaboratively.

        I enjoy working on projects that combine creativity and logic, such as designing responsive web applications and exploring the intersection of gaming and AI. One of my current projects involves developing a game inspired by Jujutsu Kaisen, where I’m delving into character animations and combat mechanics to create a unique experience.

        As I grow, I aim to contribute to the field of AI by building impactful applications that solve real-world problems. When I’m not coding, I’m either learning something new, brainstorming ideas, or working on side projects to improve my craft.

        Let’s connect and explore the endless possibilities of technology together!
